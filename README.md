**Constant Sum - built in Foundry Environment**

Built following the Smart Contract Programmers video [Constant Sum AMM Math | DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luff_OGvYtI&list=PLO5VPQH6OWdX-Rh7RonjZhOd9pb9zOnHW&index=40)

## Overview

This CSAMM is a simplified implementation of a Constant Sum Automated Market Maker (AMM) using the Solidity programming language. This smart contract facilitates the trading of two ERC20 tokens, allowing users to add and remove liquidity from the pool and swap tokens. 

## Features

- **Token Swapping**: Users can swap between two tokens with a 0.3% fee.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Users can add liquidity to the pool, earning shares representing their contribution.
- **Liquidity Removal**: Users can remove their liquidity, receiving back the underlying tokens.
